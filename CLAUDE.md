# Folder structure
- /backend - the backend folder contains all the server-side code for the application.
- /mobile - the mobile folder contains all the code for the mobile application.

# Architecture
- See README.md in project root

# Code style
- All functions should have docstrings that are clear concise and only explain what is not apparent in the code.
- Only use inline comments to provide additional context or explain complex logic that is not immediately obvious from the code.

# Workflow
- Check README.md files for project information and guidelines.
- Check for reusable code before writing new code
- Prefer simplicity over abstraction and performance
- Ensure that existing comments and docstrings are updated to reflect changes in the codebase
- Ensure that all README files are up to date and accurate after making changes in the codebase
